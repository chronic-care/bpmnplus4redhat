The seer-mapper service has been deployed and can be accessed at https://seer-mapper.dev.openplatform.healthcare. The Swagger UI page is https://seer-mapper.dev.openplatform.healthcare/swagger-ui.html. I have not figured out how to document the “optional” parameters in Swagger, so just be warned if trying to use that page.
 
There are two required parameters when calling the service: resourceType and patientId.
 
resourceTypes currently supported are: Condition, Encounter, Patient, Procedure and Observation.
patientId is the patientId.
 
Any other parameters passed on the call are appended to the FHIR query. As examples, the following work:
 
https://seer-mapper.dev.openplatform.healthcare/seer?resourceType=Patient&patientId=00E-131
https://seer-mapper.dev.openplatform.healthcare/seer?patientId=00E-131&resourceType=Observation&code=3094-0,8867-4
https://seer-mapper.dev.openplatform.healthcare/seer?resourceType=Procedure&patientId=00E-131&_sort=_lastUpdated&_count=1
 
There is an issue using special characters on the value of a parameter. For example, patient 00E-131 has a Procedure with a code of TWMale10+ and the plus sign is not being matched for some reason.
 
Anyway, try it out. Break it. And if you break it, please let me know how.
 
Thanks,
Gary




This is what I currently have. Please send any changes to me.
 
Endpoints (All request parameters have required set to false. Also the controller, accepts POST and PUT requests.):
${baseurl}/seer/Condition/{resourceId}?clinicalStatus=X&verificationStatus=X&onsetDateTime=X
${baseurl}/seer/Observation/{resourceId}?valueString=X&valueQuantity=X&comparator=X&unit=X&system=X&code=X
 
There is basically no error handling. So if something does not update, it is just ignored.
The values for clinicalStatus, verificationStatus and comparator will have to be the Enum values from the respective FHIR class (Condition.ConditionClinicalStatus, Condition.ConditionVerificationStatus and Quantity.QuantityComparator).
 
 
For a Condition, if a value is not empty it will be updated.
 
For an Observation:
               If the valueString is not empty and the Observation.value is currently a String
Then
Update valueString
               Else if valueQuantity is not empty and the Observation.value is currently a Quantity
               Then
                              Update Quantity.value
                              If comparator is not emtpy
                              Then
                                             Update comparator
                              End if
                              If unit is not empty
                              Then
                                             Update unit
                              End if
                              If system is not empty
                              Then
                                             Update system
                              End if
                              If code is not empty
                              Then
                                             Update code
                              End if
               End if
